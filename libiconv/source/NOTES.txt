Despite appearances, libiconv does NOT depend on libintl (a part of
gettext). The test for gettext components is actually part of the boilerplate
for autotools, and in this case is not needed by libiconv.

In fact, libiconv is required by gettext, so this project HAS to be able to
compile without gettext.
