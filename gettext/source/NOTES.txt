GETTEXT NOTES
=============


Headers
-------
We have had difficulties because the android ndk has incomplete header files
for gnulib. gettext is the package that creates spawn.h and langinfo.h, but
when it tries to read these headers, if finds the incomplete ones in the
toolchain, and barfs.

To fix this we've moved <SYSROOT>/usr/include/spawn.h and langinfo.h into a
<SYSROOT>/usr/include/bad subdirectory, where they shouldn't be found by
accident.
